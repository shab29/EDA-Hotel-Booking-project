# EDA-Hotel-Booking-project
Data was provided with more than 1 Lakh booking details of the hotel types. It contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information is from the data. The main objective is to get complete insights of the dataset, which could help hotels to get efficient business.
